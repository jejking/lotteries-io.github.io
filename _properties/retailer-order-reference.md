# Retailer Order Reference

Defines a value that identifies an [Order](../concepts/order) at a [Retailer](../concepts/retailer). The value should be an object that includes at least a `href` property whose value is a URI. Where no resolvable URL is available, then a URN should be supplied according to a scheme agreed with the recipient of the document, usually an [Operator](../concepts/operator).

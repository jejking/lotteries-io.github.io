# Retail Customer

Defines a field where data about a [Retail Customer](../concepts/retail-customer) can be found. The value should be an object with at least an `href` property whose value is a URI that identifies the customer. Where a resolvable URL cannot be provided, a URN structured according to an experimental scheme agreed with the document recipient should be used.

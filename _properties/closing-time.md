# Closing Time

On a representation of a [Particpation Pool](../concepts/participation-pool), property stating the point from which the pool is closed: that is, the point in time from which [Gaming Product Orders](../concepts/gaming-product-order) to place [Bets](../concepts/bet) in the pool will be rejected. That means the [Operator](../concepts/operator) will make no attempt to process bets for the pool after this time has passed.

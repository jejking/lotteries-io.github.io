# Metadata

Defines any necessary metadata required to process an [Order](../concepts/order). The precise scope and nature of the metadata required is defined in [Operator](../concepts/operator)-specific web application profiles but will normally at least include identities for the [Retailer](../concepts/retailer) and its [Retail Customer](../concepts/retail-customer).

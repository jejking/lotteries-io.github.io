# lotteries.io Web Application Profile

This page defines the generic Application Profile for lottery applications. It is an application profile in the sense of RFC 6906 [The 'profile' Link Relation Type'](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6906.txt). It adds additional semantics to [HAL-JSON](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html).

It is intended to be *extended* by operators to add their own particular semantics and requirements.

It consists of the *combination* of various sub-profiles, each of which may be extended and overwritten by operators as required.

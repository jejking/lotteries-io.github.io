# Draws

Link to a resource listing links to [Draws](../concepts/draw) that belong to a [Draw Series](../concepts/draw-series).

The link may be parameterised via a URI Template that specifies two optional variables:

* `fromDate`. An ISO 8601 formatted string that specifies a limit for the earliest draws (by `draw-time`) to fetch.
* `toDate`. An ISO 8601 formatted string that specifies a limit for the latest draws (by `draw-time`) to fetch.

As throughout this specification, it is recommended that dates and times be specified with a Time Zone and that the time zone be UTC.

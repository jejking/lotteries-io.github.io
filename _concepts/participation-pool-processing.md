title: Participation Pool Processing
---
A processes by which a Lottery [Operator](operator) applies the [Gaming Product](gaming-product) [Winning Scheme](winning-scheme) to the [Bets](bet) in a [Participation Pool](participation-pool).
First the [Bets](bets) are allocated to [Winning Classes](winning-class), then the function to map [Winning Classes](winning-class) to [Winnings](winning) is computed or looked up and then applied to the Bets using their associated Winning Classes, at which point direct or indirect liabilities to the [Retail Customers](retail-customer) via the [Retailer](retailer) accrue.
The processes are expected to take particular care to verify the authenticity, integrity and finality of the data being processed. They should also be repeatable. It should be possible to implement the processes independently, say for auditors or other interested stakeholders, given data formats, the [Winning Scheme](winning-scheme) and produce the exact same results given the same input parameters.

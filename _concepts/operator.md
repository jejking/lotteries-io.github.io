# Operator

Offers [Gaming Product](gaming-products) which allow [Retail Customers](retail-customer) to place [Bets](bets) on the outcome of [Draws](draw). The [Bets](bet) are collected in [Participation pools](participation-pool) that links the [Draw](draw) to the [Gaming Product](gaming-product).

The operator is not necessarily the [Draw Organiser](draw-organiser). IF it is not, then we talk about "secondary" lotteries or further derivatives.

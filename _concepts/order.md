## Order

The [Retail Customer](retail-customer) order (commonly also known as a "ticket") encompasses a map of [Gaming Product Orders](gaming-product-order) that are submitted by a [Retailer](retailer) on behalf of a [Retail Customer](retail-customer) to an [Operator](operator). The individual [Gaming Product Orders](gaming-product-orders) are organised as a map.

Additional metadata on the [Retail Customer](retail-customer) and [Retailer](retailer) is also to be supplied, for each at least a URI. Further retail customer metadata may be necessary or agreed on in future, the details of which will be exposed via application profiles.

Currently we consider that the order is accepted *atomically* by the [Operator](operator) - either all [Gaming Product Orders](gaming-product-orders) are considered successful or none are.

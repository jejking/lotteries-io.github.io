#Betting Scheme

A betting scheme is defined by an [Operator](operator) offering [Bets](bet) on the outcome of a [Draw](draw).

The betting scheme specifies the form of valid [Bets](bet).

Often, the betting scheme will be identical to the [Draw Scheme](draw-scheme), allowing the [Gaming Product](gaming-product) to use its [Winning Scheme](winning-scheme) classify the "success" of the bet's "prediction" of the draw outcome and hence allocate the [Bet](bet) to a [Winning Class](winning-class).

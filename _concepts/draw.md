# Draw

A Draw is a random event that is organised by a [Draw organiser](draw-organiser) according to a given [Draw Schedule](draw-schedule) and hence at a given "point" in time. The event is structured according to a [Draw Scheme](draw-scheme) upon which [Bets](bet) may be placed according to the [Winning Scheme(s)](winning-scheme) of one or more [Gaming Products](gaming-product).

The Draw (normally) forms part of a [Draw Series](draw-series).

We distinguish here the draw as a scheduled, random event from the [Gaming Products](gaming-product) built up around it which may require their own specific [Gaming Product Draw View](gaming-product-draw-view) which may give insights into numbers of participants, potential jackpots, etc.

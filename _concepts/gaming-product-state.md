# Gaming Product State

In some cases, the [Winning Scheme](winning-scheme) may require information about the amount of takings, distribution of previous winners and winnings, etc, from a current or past [Participation Pool](participation-pool) or [Participation Pool Processing](participation-pool-processing). The game mechanics may also include other features such as booster funds or Jackpots that must be considered.

A projection of the Gaming Product State with reference to a given [Participation Pool](participation-pool) or even [Draw](draw) may be exposed as a [Gaming Product Draw View](gaming-product-draw-view).

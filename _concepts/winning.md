# Winning

Liability owed by an [Operator](operator) to a [Retail Customer](retail-customer) following computation of the [Winning Class](winning-class) for a [Bet](bet) and the application of the quota function using the [Winning Scheme](winning-scheme) for the [Participation Pool](participation-pool) containing the bet.

Normally a winning is expressed in terms of money. In some circumstances things or services may be owed instead.

A [Retailer](retailer) claims the winning on behalf of its [Retail Customer](retail-customer). Various processes may need to be carried out before the winning is released and paid out.

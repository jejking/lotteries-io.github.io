#Retailer

A named and identifiable organisation which organises [Retail customer](retail-customer) relationships and which functions as a retail channel for one or more [Operators](operator).

The [Operator](operator) may be the same legal entity as the Retailer, or the retailer may act as a reseller. It makes sense to separate the two concepts logically.

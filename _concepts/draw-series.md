# Draw Series

A draw series is a named, branded series of [Draws](/concepts/draw) organised according to a [Draw Schedule](/concepts/draw-schedule) by a [Draw Organiser](/concepts/draw-organiser).

In this way we retain brand identity across changes in scheduling and [Draw Scheme](/concepts/draw-scheme) as these happen over time.

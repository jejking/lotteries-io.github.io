# Gaming Product
Essentially names a winning scheme from an operator given a draw scheme and a betting scheme. The schemes may change over time, but the name persists, creating a durable brand.

For example, German Lotto has undergone a series of changes to the product rules in the course of its history but continues to be marketed under a very recognisable brand.

Finally, in the case of secondary lotteries or derivative products a link may be declared to the reference gaming product.

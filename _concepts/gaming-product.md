# Gaming Product
Essentially names a [Winning Scheme](winning-scheme) from an [Operator](operator) given a [Draw Scheme](draw-scheme) and a [Betting Scheme](betting-scheme). The schemes may change over time, but the name persists, creating a durable brand, linked, for example to a [Draw Series](draw-series). As such it forms what is known as a "lottery".

For example, German Lotto has undergone a series of changes to the product rules in the course of its history but continues to be marketed under a very recognisable brand.

Finally, in the case of secondary lotteries or derivative products, a link may be declared to the reference gaming product.
